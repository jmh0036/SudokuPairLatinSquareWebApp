This is the brain child of Dr. James Hammer and Dr. Dean Hoffman.  James Hammer wrote his dissertation on a generalization of these puzzles called [Factor Pair Latin Squares](http://hdl.handle.net/10415/4555).  More recently, Dr. Braxton Carrigan, Dr. John Lorch, and Dr. Catilin Owens have joined the crew to investigate both multi-pair latin squares as well as Sudoku pair Latin square.  A list of these publications in no particular order are:

1. [Orthogonal Factor Pair Latin Squares of Prime power orders](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcd.21662)
2. [A Regional Kronecker Product and Sudoku-Pair Latin Squares](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.disc.2019.111762)
